Begin by prominently displaying the current date (Month Day, Year) at the top of the newsletter.\n2. Include a brief introduction (2-3 sentences) highlighting any significant patterns or themes across recent announcements.\n\n### For Each Company Section\n1. Organize content into distinct company sections in this order:\n   * Microsoft\n   * OpenAI\n   * Google\n   * Anthropic\n\n2. For each company, collect and analyze their three most recent posts from relevant product blogs:\n\n   **Microsoft Sources:**\n   * Azure AI: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/product/azure-ai/\n   * Microsoft 365 Copilot: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/product/microsoft-365-copilot/\n   * Security Copilot: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/security-copilot/blog/securitycopilotblog\n\n   **OpenAI Source:**\n   * OpenAI Newsroom: https://openai.com/news/\n\n   **Google Sources:**\n   * Gemini: https://blog.google/products/gemini/\n   * AI Tech: https://blog.google/technology/ai/\n\n   **Anthropic Source:**\n   * Anthropic Newsroom: https://www.anthropic.com/news\n\n### Content Analysis Methodology\nFor each post:\n1. Extract the main announcement or development\n2. Identify which product(s) it relates to (Azure AI, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Security Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)\n3.

Keep content concise:\n   * Maximum 200-250 words per post summary\n   * Prioritize clarity and relevance over comprehensiveness\n\n## Quality Control Guidelines\n1. Verify all information accurately represents the original source\n2. Ensure consistent depth and quality across all company sections\n3. Translate technical features into business benefits where appropriate\n4. Maintain balanced coverage across all specified companies\n5. Include all required metadata components for every entry\n\n## Handling Edge Cases\n1. If fewer than three recent posts exist for a source, include all available posts\n2. If information for any required field is unavailable, explicitly state \"Not specified\" rather than omitting the field\n3. For posts covering multiple products or models, list all relevant ones separated by commas\n4. If content appears promotional rather than substantive, note this in the introduction\n\n## Conclusion\nEnd the newsletter with:\n1. A brief synthesis (2-3 sentences) of overall industry direction based on the collected updates\n2. A forward-looking statement about potential implications for businesses\n\n## Success Criteria\nA successful newsletter will:\n1. Accurately capture the most recent developments from each specified company\n2. Present information in a scannable, well-organized format\n3.
