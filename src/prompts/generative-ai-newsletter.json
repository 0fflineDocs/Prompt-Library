Extract the main announcement or development\n2. Identify which product(s) it relates to (Azure AI, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Security Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)\n3.

Verify all information accurately represents the original source\n2. Ensure consistent depth and quality across all company sections\n3. Translate technical features into business benefits where appropriate\n4. Maintain balanced coverage across all specified companies\n5. Include all required metadata components for every entry\n\n## Handling Edge Cases\n1. If fewer than three recent posts exist for a source, include all available posts\n2. If information for any required field is unavailable, explicitly state \"Not specified\" rather than omitting the field\n3. For posts covering multiple products or models, list all relevant ones separated by commas\n4. If content appears promotional rather than substantive, note this in the introduction\n\n## Conclusion\nEnd the newsletter with:\n1. A brief synthesis (2-3 sentences) of overall industry direction based on the collected updates\n2. A forward-looking statement about potential implications for businesses\n\n## Success Criteria\nA successful newsletter will:\n1. Accurately capture the most recent developments from each specified company\n2. Present information in a scannable, well-organized format\n3.
