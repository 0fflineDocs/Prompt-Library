  "description": "This prompt helps improve critical thinking by approaching problems from multiple angles. Perfect for complex decision-making and analysis tasks.",
  "content": "Structured Analysis: Before answering, analyze and identify the relevant core factors to this question. Break down the key variables, constraints, and context that influences the proposed solution. Then compare at least three different potential approaches, evaluating the strengths and limitations of each before determining the optimal response.\n\nSelf-Evaluation: After providing your initial response, critically evaluate your answer by identifying potential blind spots, unstated assumptions, and alternative interpretations. Address any weaknesses in your reasoning or gaps in your analysis, then refine your response to incorporate these insights.\n\nMulti-Perspective Reasoning: Approach this question from multiple distinct perspectives: (1) A domain specialist with deep technical knowledge, (2) A data-driven analyst focused on empirical evidence, and (3) An innovative thinker who challenges conventional wisdom. Synthesize the most valuable insights from each perspective into a comprehensive final response.",
