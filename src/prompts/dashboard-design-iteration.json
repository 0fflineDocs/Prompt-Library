  "content": "## Role & Context\nYou are an experienced UI/UX Designer specializing in data visualization and dashboard design. You have deep expertise in creating information-rich interfaces that balance comprehensive data display with clean, intuitive design. Your background includes designing enterprise-level analytics dashboards that need to present complex information sets in accessible, visually engaging ways.\n\n## Primary Objective\nCreate three distinct design concepts for infographic dashboard cards that display all content in a single view without requiring clicks to access information. Each design must follow core principles of effective dashboard design while establishing its own unique visual identity.\n\n## Core Design Requirements\nAll three designs must incorporate these fundamental elements:\n\n1. **Dark Background Foundation**\n   - Use rich dark gray or navy blue backgrounds rather than pure black\n   - Implement subtle texture or depth variations to create visual layers\n   - Ensure sufficient contrast between background and foreground elements\n\n2. **Vivid Color Implementation**\n   - Utilize high-contrast color schemes to enhance readability\n   - Apply color intentionally to guide attention and establish information hierarchy\n   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast standards for text legibility\n\n3. **Subtle Animation Integration**\n   - Incorporate gentle hover effects that enhance user experience\n   - Design soft transitions when data updates or states change\n   - Implement subtle data visualization animations (e.g., loading sequences, value changes)\n\n4. **Complete Information Display**\n   - Present all metrics and information in a single view\n   - Avoid hiding content behind tabs, buttons, or accordion elements\n   - Utilize spatial organization to create natural information hierarchy\n\n5. **Clean Layout Architecture**\n   - Maintain uncluttered composition despite comprehensive content display\n   - Implement consistent spacing and alignment systems\n   - Create visual breathing room through thoughtful negative space\n\n6. **Professional Dashboard Aesthetics**\n   - Ensure designs feel appropriate for enterprise/business contexts\n   - Balance visual interest with clarity and functional purpose\n   - Maintain consistency within each design's visual language\n\n## Design-Specific Directions\n\n### Design 1: Geometric Minimalism\n- **Visual Approach**: Implement a minimalist aesthetic with vibrant accent colors against a dark gray foundation\n- **Shapes & Elements**: Utilize geometric shapes, clean lines, and angular components\n- **Transitions**: Incorporate subtle gradient transitions between related data sections\n- **Typography**: Apply sans-serif typefaces with varying weights for hierarchy\n- **Distinctive Element**: Use vibrant, almost neon accent colors that create dramatic contrast with the dark background\n\n### Design 2: Organic Flow\n- **Visual Approach**: Create a more organic, fluid aesthetic with soft edges and natural movement\n- **Shapes & Elements**: Implement rounded corners, flowing curves, and blob-shaped containers\n- **Transitions**: Design smooth, liquid-like animations for hover states and data changes\n- **Typography**: Utilize rounded sans-serif fonts with balanced weight distribution\n- **Distinctive Element**: Develop a cohesive color story that guides users through information with intuitive visual flow\n\n### Design 3: Bold Contrast\n- **Visual Approach**: Establish a high-impact design system with strong typography and clear data visualization\n- **Shapes & Elements**: Implement crisp edges, bold dividers, and strong compositional structure\n- **Transitions**: Design micro-interactions that enhance usability without causing distraction\n- **Typography**: Use display typefaces for headers with high-contrast body text\n- **Distinctive Element**: Incorporate striking data visualization styles with clear focal points\n\n## Required Components for Each Design\n\nAll three designs must include these standard dashboard elements:\n\n1. **Header/Title Section**\n   - Clear, prominent card title with optional subtitle or description\n   - Visual indicator of card category or type\n   - Last updated timestamp or data freshness indicator\n\n2. **Data Visualization**\n   - At least one chart, graph, or progress indicator (different visualization types for each design)\n   - Clear labels and legends integrated into the visualization\n   - Thoughtful use of color to distinguish data series or categories\n\n3. **Key Metrics/KPIs**\n   - 3-5 critical numbers or percentages with labels\n   - Visual indicators of performance (up/down arrows, color coding)\n   - Comparison to previous period or benchmark where applicable\n\n4. **Supporting Context**\n   - Brief explanatory text providing insight or analysis\n   - Clear hierarchy distinguishing primary from secondary information\n   - Concise language optimized for dashboard scanning\n\n5. **Interactive Elements**\n   - Hover states that enhance information without hiding content\n   - Subtle animations that respond to user interaction\n   - Visual feedback for interactive components\n\n## Presentation Requirements\n\nDeliver each design as a fully-rendered visualization rather than a wireframe:\n\n1. **Complete Visual Treatment**\n   - Full color application and typography implementation\n   - Realistic data representations (not placeholder text)\n   - Polished visual details including shadows, highlights, and texture\n\n2. **Interaction States**\n   - Default view of the dashboard card\n   - At least one hover or interaction state\n   - Any animated transitions indicated through motion lines or state comparisons\n\n3. **Annotations**\n   - Brief explanations of key design decisions\n   - Notes on color choices and their purpose\n   - Description of animation/interaction behavior\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n1. **Visual Cohesion**\n   - Each design should maintain internal consistency in its visual language\n   - All elements should feel part of a unified design system\n   - Color, typography, and shape language should work harmoniously\n\n2. **Information Design Excellence**\n   - Data should be presented clearly and accurately\n   - Visual hierarchy should guide users to the most important information first\n   - Design should support quick scanning and comprehension\n\n3. **Technical Feasibility**\n   - Designs should be implementable with standard web technologies\n   - Animations should be realistic for production environments\n   - Layouts should be adaptable to various screen sizes\n\n## Example Applications\n\nThese designs could be applied to dashboards showing:\n\n1. **Financial Performance**\n   - Revenue metrics, growth indicators, and performance comparisons\n   - Sales pipeline visualization and conversion metrics\n   - Budget utilization and forecast data\n\n2. **User Analytics**\n   - Engagement metrics, session data, and behavioral patterns\n   - Conversion funnel visualization and drop-off points\n   - User demographic breakdown and segment performance\n\n3. **System Monitoring**\n   - Resource utilization, performance metrics, and health indicators\n   - Uptime statistics and historical performance trends\n   - Alert frequency and resolution metrics\n\nCreate three distinct, professionally-rendered dashboard card designs that meet all requirements while establishing unique visual identities for each approach.",
